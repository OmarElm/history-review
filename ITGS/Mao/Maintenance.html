	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Once he had solidified the PRC, he looked towards solidifying his power over the people. While he claimed was democratic, Mao ran a state where officials were hand picked in mock trials, where the military forcefully redistributed the land in order to wipe out the Bourgeiosie, and terror tactics were used ot subdue the people. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Repression, Terror, and Collectivisation </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Similar to Stalin, Mao collectivised Agriculture, partly to follow his communist ideals but also because he wanted full control over the economy. It did not work as well as it would should have, and the later attempts at steel production also did not work as well. This failure undermined Mao's image. To combat this, Mao executed public officials to show his ruthlessness. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Propaganda </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> Mao portrayed himself as a saviour but amplifying his good deeds. For example, he gave women rights and banned child marriages. He created a lot of propaganda and monitored all forms of media/culture. He also made a little red book. All citizens were required to have one, and it detailed the ideals of Maoism. It was very succesful. </p>
