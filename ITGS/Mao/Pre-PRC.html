	<h1 style="margin-right: 265px; margin-top: -10px; font-size:50px; text-decoration: underline">Pre-PRC</h1>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> The CCP allied for the KMT to defend themselves from other factions. Eventually the KMT turned agianst the CCP, and drove them into the interior. The KMT also had control on Nanjing, which was the southern capital of China at the time. However, they still faced the CCP in the east and the Japanese to the west. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> The Long March </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> At the time, the KMT was chasing the CCP in the Southern Chinese Interior. The CCP needed to escape, and thus the Long March was simply a glorified retreat. Even more soldiers were lost during the march due to warfare, starvation, and freezing to death. They also used Guerilla tactics. Despite heavy losses, Mao cemented his role as the legendary leader of the PRC. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> The Civil War </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> The PRC and KMT temporarily allied to repel the Japanese invaders during WW2, but afterwards they were at war once more. The KMT was recieved funding from the US and the CCP from the USSR. Despite the KMT's previous success, the CCP used Guerilla warfare to repel the KMT to Taiwan, where they remain today. The PRC cemented its rule in China, and founded itself as the People's Republic of China. </p>
