	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> While the civil war was won with tactics, it was also won with policies the CCP developed to combat the KMT. One main factor was the legtimiacy of the factions in the eyes of the people. Mao's version of communism was different from the marxist leninists, as it focused on peasents instead of urban workers. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> WW2 </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> One of the main examples was during WW2. The CCP was able to fight the Japanese with more affectiveness due to guerilla tactics, in comparison to the KMT's less efficient methods. Also, the CCP retreated less than the KMT. The KMT recieved a lot of aid from Britain and the US, which the people did not like as it reminded them of the spheres of influence. The KMT also attacked the CCP while it was fighting the Japanese, something seen as betrayal in the eyes of the people. This put the CCP as the legitimate Chinese faction. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Treatement of the people </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> The reason that the CCP gained the support of the people was because the KMT treated the peasants badly. Taxes in KMT controlled lands were very high, and in comparison, the CCP was focused on redistributing lands, increasing education, and building infrastructure. </p>
