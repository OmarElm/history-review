	<h1 style="margin-right: 265px; margin-top: -10px; font-size:50px; text-decoration: underline">Domestic</h1>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Mao ran some domestic policies with mixed success. Oftentimes, the goals were set to high or the goals were not even beneficial. His 4 pests campaign, for example, succeeded in that the pest were succesfully removed, but failed in that the pests kept insects in check and this lead to a locust storm, and then famine, which killed 30 million.  </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Cultural Revolution and 100 flowers </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Mao had become relatively paranoid, and as such he decided that any opposition was to be crushed. The hundred flower campaign invited people to criticise the government, however, after too much criticism was recieved, he used it to purge any intellectual enemies. The Cultural revolution was more of a purge in that government officials were killed, humiliated, and even sent to labor camps for arbitrary crimes.	</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Great Leap Forward and the 5 Year Plans </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> The Great leap forward was an attempt to build infrastructure and advance the country. Mao encouraged collectivism, he wanted citizens to donate their money and extra metal to the government to build railways. This failed as the metal was poor. Utlimately, it failed and the people were close to revolting, and people starved. The Five year plan was mildly successful. However, the second one was a complete disaster and 30 million people died. </p>
