  		<text style="color:white; font-size: 15px; text-align: center;">"The popular resentment towards Weimar republic was a major factor in helping Hitler seizing power in 1933." -Gerhard Ritter </text>

  		<text style="color:white; font-size: 15px; text-align: center;">"Chance, luck and tragic miscalculations were a major factor bringing Hitler to power, and causing the downfall of the Weimar republic. There was nothing inevitable about Hitlerâ€™s triumph in 1933.  -Ian Kershaw

  		<text style="color:white; font-size: 15px; text-align: center;">"A major factor contributing to the collapse of the Weimar republic was the shrewdness of the political leaders in the Nazi party. The government believed they could control Hitler in his new position as chancellor in 1933. However, they were wrong Hitler managed to outmanoeuvre the government and establish a single party state thanks to his position as chancellor." 	-E. Anderson

	<h1 style="margin-right: 265px; margin-top: -10px; font-size:50px; text-decoration: underline">EMERGENCE</h1>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> The Ideology of Nazism revolves around Mein Kampf, a book Hitler wrote while in prison. He detailed his belief that Germany was to be an Aryan Nation, and so it must exterminate Jews and expand its Lebensraum into Slavic lands. He also rejected the treaty of Versailles, and beleived that power should be kept with one person in a state.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Creation of the Nazi party</h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Hitler joined the NSDAP, originally a Worker's Party, and became its leader in 1921. He wished to unite all Germans into one state and to gain land for Germany. He also wished to reject the Treaty of Versailles. The Nazi Party also had the SA, an armed force loyal to the party that silenced opponents. In 1923, the Nazis attempted a putsch in Munich, which failed when Police men fired at them. This is how Hitler got arrested and wrote Mein Kampf in prison.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline"> Democratic Appeals </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> After the Putsch, Hitler decided that the best way into power was through the people themselves. He hoped to take control of the Reichstag democratically. This was because he was aware of the country's weak electoral system and wished to exploit it. He also wished to appeal to the German people in the midst of the Great depression. After campaigning and appealing to people as their way to restore Germany, Hitler managed to end up as Chancellor.</p>
