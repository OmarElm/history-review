	<h1 style="margin-right: 265px; margin-top: -10px; font-size:50px; text-decoration: underline">ADOLF HITLER</h1>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -36px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Hailing from Vienna, Adolf Hitler joined the NSDAP and quickly climbed the ranks. What originally started as a Worker's Party became known for its facist right-wing rhetoric and use of violence. It was popular for its promises of restoring glory to Germany and its focus on Volk, or people. It was also popular with the established conservatives because it was anti-left wing.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -665px; text-decoration: underline"> Hitler in Power </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; text-indent: 30px; text-align: left; width: 375px;"> Due to the way the election laws worked in Weimar Germany, Hitler became Chancellor. One of the first things he did as Chancellor was become a de facto dictator. He dissolved the German parliament and became FÃ¼hrer of the Third Reich. From there, he silenced opposition by stifling free speech. News was censored, and even certain art banned for being "degenrate". A strong Propaganda machine indoctrinated the masses, controlling all media in Germany.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline"> The Second World War </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Hitler's foreign policy was incredibly expansionist. Germany made claims to regions and countries such as Czecheslovakia and the Rhineland. Because of the Allied policy of appeasement, Hitler received what he asked for. In the end, it was only after the invasion of Poland in 1939 that Britain and France declared war on Germany, and the Second World war started. At the time, Germany was part of the Axis Powers, which included Italy and Japan. In 1945, the 3rd Reich surrendered to the Allied powers.</p>
