	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> The first thing Hitler did as Chancellor was increase his power. He justified this using the Reichstag fire, which is believed to have been caused by a Communist. With this power, he sent the SA to attack, kill and otherwise discredit German Communism. He disolved German Democracy completely after gaining a majority in the Reichstag. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Crushing External Opposition </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Eventually, Hitler completely outlawed other parties. Without a democracy to demand change from, parties that voted for Hitler were disbanded. This move was mainly done to completely remove Communism from Germany. To consolidate his power within the party, he held a Purge known as the night of the long knives, in which party officials such as the head of the SA were assasinated. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Internal Opposition </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> Unorganised opposition remained, however. Despite being ideologically similar, the most opposition came from traditionalist right wing conservatives. Even the youth had those against Hitler. The church remained a constant problem for the Nazis, as religion was so rooted into German society that even the Nazis could not fully control it. However diverse the opposition however, it was insufficient. Hitler was very popular with the German people, and because of propaganda and indoctrination, internal resistance posed no threat until WW2. </p>
