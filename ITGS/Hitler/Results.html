	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Nazi Economic Policy revolved around achieving three main goals: Recovering from the Economic Crisis, Rearmament, and Autarky. By 1939, they had recovered, but experienced limited success with Rearmament and Autarky. This was because unlike their Allied neighbours, they had no empire to draw on for raw resources.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Social Policies </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Nazi society was very much totalitarian, which extended into education and youth groups. Nazi influence created party loyalty in German minors, so that they would be loyal to the cause. Special classes, such as German Heritage and Race Science were introduced. Women lost many of the rights they had in Weimar Germany, and were now treated less than men. "Undesireables", which included the disabled and Jews, were subject to harsh treatment and murdered. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline"> Culture in Nazi Germany </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> As previously mentioned, Nazi Totalitarian policy dictated that Non-conventional, Non-European (usually Non-German) art was degenrate. That meant Abstract art, Jazz music, Anything made by a Jew, even the native Bauhaus style. Hitler also wanted to bolster the German spirit, and used Goebbels to propagandise the news and events like the Berlin Olympics. The propaganda machine was very strong, as it controlled all media in Germany. </p>
