	<h1 style="margin-right: 265px; margin-top: -10px; font-size:50px; text-decoration: underline">EMERGENCE</h1>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Before Lenin died, he did not leave a clear successor. He did, however, reccomend that Stalin be removed from power. Before his death, Stalin was already very powerful in the party. He had high positions in the three councils, and upon hearing his death, he made himself chief mourner and claimed to be very close to Lenin, despite this not being true. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Becoming Lenin's successor </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Stalin furthered the cult of Lenin and even renamed Petrograd to Leningrad in his honor. However, not all his attempts were peaceful. He also focused on removing any other possible successors; mainly Trotsky, who was a war hero and the architect of the October Revolution. He did this by amplifying Trotsky's Opposition to the NEP and the fact that Trotsky used to be a Menshevik. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Stalin and the NEP </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> The NEP was meant to be a temporary measure instated by Lenin, however, because of Stalin's decision to display himself as Lenin's disciple, he praised it heavily and doubted any who criticised it, despite its more capitalist nature clashing with Bolshevik ideals. Once he came into a position of power, he got rid ended the NEP. </p>
