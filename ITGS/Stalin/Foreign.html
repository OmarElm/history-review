		<hr>
  		<text style="color:white; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">There are two main historian opinions: That Stalin sought an alliance with France, or that he actually wanted an alliance with Germany. However, evidence points towards a French alliance.</text>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> The rest of the world was uncomfortable with communism. However, they were willing to ally with the Soviets to defend themselves, such as France. Due to its closed economy, the Soviets were not as affected by the Great Depression. Despite Nazi anti-communism, the Soviet's signed the Molotov-Ribentrop pact, which was a non-aggression pact.   </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Course of WW2 Opposition </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Stalin was very worried that he might have to deal with a two-front war, which he did once the axis powers signed the anti-commintern pact. When the Nazis broke the M-R pact, things looked bad until the siege of Leningrad. However, the Soviets experienced the heaviest loss of life. During the war, the Soviets "liberated" Baltic and Eastern European states, claiming them under their influence. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Reasons for victory </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> Stalin succeeded because his 5 Year plans helped them prepared the country for war. Because the economy was closed, it was very easy for him to transition to a war time economy. He also made it clear that any surrenderers were to be killed. He also created a lot of propaganda to further the war effort. He also recieved help from the other allies in the war.</p>
