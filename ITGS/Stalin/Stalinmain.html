	<h1 style="margin-right: 265px; margin-top: -10px; font-size:50px; text-decoration: underline">Joseph Stalin</h1>

	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -36px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Coming from Georgia, Joseph Stalin became part of the Bolshevik vanguard with the likes of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Despite becoming a close party member, Lenin explicitly stated that Stalin should not take power should he die. After his death, Stalin took power, and to consolidate his rule he villainised Trotsky, a party member of equal regard. No one dared challenge him. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -665px; text-decoration: underline"> The Early Soviet Union </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; text-indent: 30px; text-align: left; width: 375px;"> Before becoming the Soviet Union, Russia was under Czarist rule. During this time, there was unrest because of various domestic problems such as working conditions, famine, and war. Vladimir Lenin took power and created the Soviet Union, but also fought in civil wars and had famines. At this time, Russia was also shunned from the rest of the world because of their political differences.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline"> Stalin in Power </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Stalin was famous for his authoritarian rule; political opponents were sent to gulags or dissapeared, often claimed to be Trotskyists attempting another coup. Despite drafting a constitution allowing for freedom of speech and protest, Stalin was anything but for such expression in the Soviet Union.</p>
