	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Stalin faced a lot of opposition, and once his legitimacy was guaranteed, he consolidated his power by silencing those who opposed him. He created a cult of personality so that people would follow him, which was so powerful anyone Stalin disliked could have their careers ended. He also developed a lot of propaganda and censorship. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Opposition </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Even during his rise to power, Stalin faced opposition from Lenin and other party members. He also faced opposition from the workers and peasants, as his five year plan lead to a lower standard of living. Despite supporting Bolsheviks, the policy worsened their lives. There was also religious opposition, as Stalin destroyed churches and mosques. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Response to Opposition </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> Stalin responded to the Opposition through purges and gulags. By this point he had enough power to be seen as the supreme leader. The purges were done because of internal party dissent; Stalin knew that despite his expansion of his cult of personality, older party members would continue to oppose him if they were not removed. The Gulags were labor camps where political enemies were sent. Used in tandem with arrests they were powerful tools of intimidation. </p>
