	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Stalin was far less progressive than lenin and as such he rolled back a lot of the equality Lenin gave citizens. However Women still had jobs and joined the army in WW2. He also expanded the anti-religious sentiment to destroying churches and mosques. There were still underground churches but that worshiped in private. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -635px; text-decoration: underline"> Collectivisation </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> One of Stalin's main economic policies was the collectivisation of agriculture. What that essentiallly means is the complete control of food and equipment by the state. This was not very popular and as such farmers rebelled. This farmers were called Kulaks and enemies of the state, and sent to the Gulags. While it succeeded, it failed because of its brutality and loss of human life.		</p>

	<h2 style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> 5 Year Plans </h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> 5 Year plans were moves in the opposite direction of the NEP. The first one called for complete state control of resources in order to rapidly industrialise the country, as Russia was mostly Peasantry at the time. This meant railways, steel, and Electricity. Working conditions lowered across the country, and quotas were never reached, however, output did increase. A similar result came from the 2nd and 3rd 5 year plans, in which rearmament was the focus to prepare from WW2.</p>
