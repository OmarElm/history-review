	<p style="margin-left: 360px; margin-top: -40px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Stalin claimed that without his leadership, the soviets would have lost the war. Regardless, the Soviet Union had won and become a political super power. The war was not without its toll on the nation, however. Russia had the most casualties from WW2, and as such a lot of rebuilding was required to repair the loss of life to the Union. </p>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; ; text-align: left; width: 375px; text-indent: 30px"> Time was bad for the citizens after the war. As such, another 5 year plan was carried out restore the country. But it was not entirely focused on restoration, resoucres were diverted to the new cold war between the West and Russia, especially the construction of an Atomic Bomb. Stalin also tried to place the newly claimed Eastern bloc under soviet control. </p>

	<p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -20px; font-size:20px; text-align: left; width: 375px;text-indent: 30px"> As Stalin aged, he became more and more paranoid. He started more purges and built more and more Gulag camps, and placed more and more people in those Gulags. He also purged leadership in the new Eastern bloc. Eventually, a purge turned upon doctors in the Kremlin. Without their skills, Stalin died of Heart Complications, ending his reign. </p>
